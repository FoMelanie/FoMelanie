I’m interested in analyzing the relationships between different data sets and draw conclusions from it.
I’m currently learning data analysis skills: statistics, data visualization, machine learning.
I already performed biological data analysis during my PhD in biology: I studied the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolomic data in rodents.
