- 👋 Hi, I’m @FoMelanie
- 👀 I’m interested in analyzing the relationships between different data sets and draw conclusions from it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis skills: statistics, data visualization, machine learning.
- 💞️ I already performed biological data analysis during my PhD in biology: I studied the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolomic data in rodents.
